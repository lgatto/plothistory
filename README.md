# Store all plots in or across sessions

The `plothistory` package allows to store all plots generated during a
session in a user-defined directory, alike all commands stored in the
`.Rhistory` file. These directories can be reused across different
sessions to keep storing plots.

The [vignette](https://lgatto.github.io/plothistory/articles/plothistory.html) provides more details.
